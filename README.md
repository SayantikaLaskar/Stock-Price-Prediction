# Stock Price Prediction


## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning models. By analyzing past market data, we attempt to forecast future movements of stock prices to assist in trading decisions.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Fetch historical stock data using APIs or web scraping techniques.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.
- **Model Training:** Train models on historical data and optimize hyperparameters.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Obtain historical stock data using provided scripts or APIs.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the data and handle missing values if any.
   - Transform data into a suitable format for model training.
   
3. **EDA:**
   - Explore data using visualizations to understand patterns and correlations.
   
4. **Model Training:**
   - Choose a model (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, etc.) and train it on historical data.
   - Tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.
